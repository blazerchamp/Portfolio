#### Welcome to my GitHub page! Here is where you'll find proof of my passion for software development!

#### Projects: 

Capstone Project: Never Ending Nightmare (Currently in development)
A team game project deployed in VR using Oculus Rift to allow users to experience the thrill as they escape from a virtual haunted level. Developed using C#, Unity3D, and Oculus Rift API.

Graphical Social Networking:
My very first development project is a social networking website which implements a draw function which allows for visual communication between users. Developed artsy tools using JavaScript and JQuery, and used JSP and MySQL to allow users to exchange messages with each other.
